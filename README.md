# Do not use this library!

This library currently uses a **patched version of virtual-dom** (#20), and it
is unclear if it will ever work. If you are looking for Material Design in Elm,
please take a look at [elm-mdc](https://github.com/aforemny/elm-mdc);


# Material Components for Elm

**This library is an early prototype:** It is not published yet and
documentation is missing. If you want to try it already, load the CSS and JS
assets from [GitHub Pages](https://aforemny.github.io/material-components-elm),
and refer to the [Demo's source code](demo) for documentation.


## Quick start

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://aforemny.github.io/material-components-elm/material-components-elm.min.css">
<script src="https://aforemny.github.io/material-components-elm/material-components-elm.min.js"></script>
```

Refer to the [simple counter example](examples/simple-counter) for a minimal
starting point, specifically to the files
[`src/Main.elm`](examples/simple-counter/src/Main.elm) and
[`page.html`](examples/simple-counter/page.html).
